Terminal screenshot of the server hosted on my machine and streamlit UT screenshot with an audio transcription are in the assignment 8 screenshot.

Notes and Challenges 
The biggest challenge that came with this assignment was owning a Windows laptop. The command shown in the README.md file were all command in Mac terminal not deisgned for Windows. Therefore I had to use Ubuntu (WSL) and move between command line and Ubuntu terminal. I also had to download packages such as pip, streamlit, etc in order to run the command to host the server on my laptop.
I also had a connection error after I run the streamlit UI therefore I wasn't able to get the transcript of the audio.
